# data-cleaning-essentials
This project delves into the essential world of data cleaning, equipping you with the skills to transform messy datasets into reliable sources for analysis. You'll explore various techniques to eliminate errors, inconsistencies, and missing values, ultimately preparing data for robust exploration and modeling.

## Datasets
The project will utilize the following datasets:

2. [[Dataset 2 Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=CAvideos.csv)]

## Key Concepts and Challenges
The project aims to address the following key concepts and challenges in data cleaning:

### Data Integrity
Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the cleaning process.

### Missing Data Handling
Dealing with missing values by either imputing them or making informed decisions on how to handle gaps in the dataset.

### Duplicate Removal
Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness.

### Standardization
Consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis.

### Outlier Detection
Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model performance.

## Project Structure
The project will be organized into the following main components:

1. **Data Exploration**: Exploring the datasets to understand their structure, identify potential issues, and gain insights into the data cleaning requirements.
2. **Data Cleaning Plan**: Developing a comprehensive plan to address the identified issues and challenges in the datasets.
3. **Data Cleaning Implementation**: Implementing the data cleaning plan using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).
4. **Data Quality Assurance**: Validating the cleaned datasets to ensure data integrity, consistency, and reliability.
5. **Documentation**: Documenting the data cleaning process, techniques used, and any assumptions or decisions made during the project.
